									<h3>Your son can be King of the Mound</h3>
									<p>If your son is just missing that little something or just needs that little edge to get him over the top, then P3 is for you. With a healthy arm, increased velocity and command, and all the confidence that comes with that he will surely pitch at the level you know he is capable of.</p>
									<p>It's not as hard, and it's not as complicated as you think. It just takes a consistent, focused and safe training program built by experts in the field.</p><br>
									
									<h3>Speed is the first thing noticed</h3>
									<p>"If a scout is scouting a high school pitcher he is looking for some key things: desire, size, <strong>injury free</strong>, and, <strong>probably most of all, a live arm that can produce a 90 mph fastball for a right hander or 87 mph for a left-hander"</strong>.</p>

									<h3>Parents Love P3</h3>
									<p>"As a parent, I certainly want to see my son get the best instruction I can afford, but I also want to make sure he has fun doing it. This camp exceeded my expectations.  We were very happy with the program and are excited to participate again this Summer!"</p>
									<h4>Grace Mendoza<br />
									Son gained 3mph on fastball</h4><br>
									
									<p>"I enrolled both my 12U & 14U sons in the P3 pitching training during the off season. I was very pleased with the results. They learned many drills and exercises that helped with power &amp; strength in both legs and arms. Both boys improved in 60 yard time, and their pitching velocity. I attended all sessions and saw boys of all ages improve through the program. Both Aggie and Jimmy did an excellent job of instruction, pushing both age groups. I would recommend the P3 program for all boys who are striving to be pitchers."</p>
