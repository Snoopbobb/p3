							<h2>This program has produced pitch speed increases of up to 6 mph!</h2>
							<p>No, this is not a "Few Quick Tips" from a generic coach with no experience. No, it's not a "seminar" in pitch theory and mechanics that leaves you wondering how to execute and how to actually get results.</p>
							<p>Your son is probably willing to put in the time and work in a program that actually works. After all,<strong> imagine the confidence he would have on the mound being able to throw 3-6 mph faster!</strong></p>
